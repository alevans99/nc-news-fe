# NC News

NC News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website.

NC News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article, as well as submitting their own articles and creating new topics.

## About the Project

NC News is the combination of two projects created during my training as a Junior Full-Stack Developer. The projects were split into two separate sprints, firstly the backend for the app was created to provide a RESTful API to allow the website functionality.

You can visit the backend project here: [https://github.com/alevans99/nc-news](https://github.com/alevans99/nc-news)

The second sprint added a frontend to the project using React.
